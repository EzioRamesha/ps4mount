# PS4Mount

Play PS4 fake PKGs on a jailbroken PS5 straight from a USB drive, without installing them.

Put the game (and its update) `.pkg` files on a USB drive, plug it in and load `ps4mount.elf`.
PS4Mount finds the packages, adds the games to the home screen and lets you play them from the
drive. Nothing is copied to the console storage, and deleting a game on the console only removes
it from the library: the `.pkg` stays on the drive.

## Features

- Detects PS4 fake PKGs (game, update and add-ons) in the root of any connected USB drive, or in other
  folders chosen in the settings.
- Adds the games to the home screen with their icon, name and update version.
- Applies updates: put the update `.pkg` next to the game and it is picked up automatically.
- Installs add-ons (DLC), with data or unlock-only. An add-on is matched to its game by title ID, or by
  the add-on IDs the game lists (so add-ons of another region of the same game work too).
- Adds many games in groups, so a drive with dozens of games does not overload the console.
- Games run from the drive; no internal storage is used for the packages.
- Deleting a game from the PS5 removes it from the library only. The `.pkg` is never deleted.
- Notifications while scanning (how many games were found on each drive) and for added and removed
  games.
- A web panel, also available as **PS4Mount** in the **Media** tab, to see the games and add or
  remove them from the library.

## Requirements

- A jailbroken PS5 with fake PKG support (for example etaHEN with kstuff).
  Tested on firmware **13.20**. Other firmware versions are untested.
- An ELF loader listening on port **9021** to send the payload.
- Access to the kernel log: either **klogsrv** running on port 3232, or no other payload reading
  `/dev/klog`. PS4Mount reads the system log to know when a game starts and when a delete is
  confirmed. Without it, games cannot start (see [How it works](#how-it-works)).
- A USB drive formatted as **exFAT**.
- PS4 **fake** PKGs (game, and optionally its update and add-ons). Retail PKGs are not supported.

## Usage

Download `ps4mount.elf` from the [Releases](https://github.com/gasb07/ps4mount/releases) page
(or [build it](#building)).

1. Copy the PS4 game `.pkg` (and its update and add-on `.pkg` files, if you have them) to the **root**
   of the USB drive. The file names do not matter.
2. Plug the drive into the PS5.
3. Send `ps4mount.elf` to the ELF loader (port 9021). Do this after every console boot, or add it to
   the payloads your jailbreak loads automatically.
4. Wait for the notifications:
   - `Scanning usb0 for PS4 games...`
   - `usb0: 2 PS4 game(s) found, 2 new or updated`
   - `Adding 1/2: <game name> (CUSAxxxxx)`
   - `<game name> ready to play`
5. Start the game from the home screen.

On the first run PS4Mount moves every package it uses into a folder per game on the same drive:

```
/ps4/CUSAxxxxx/app.pkg                          game
/ps4/CUSAxxxxx/patch.pkg                        update (optional)
/ps4/CUSAxxxxx/addcont/CUSAyyyyy/<LABEL>/ac.pkg add-on (optional)
```

A game is reported as ready only after its add-ons are installed too. An add-on whose game is not on the
same drive stays where it is and waits: it is moved and installed as soon as its game is on the drive.
The scan notification says how many add-ons are waiting.

Keep this layout. To add more games later, copy their `.pkg` files to the root of the drive again.

### Web panel

Open **PS4Mount** in the **Media** tab, or browse to `http://<PS5 IP>:8770` from any device on
the same network. The panel shows every game found on the connected drives, with its state:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Ready | In the library and ready to play |
| Running | The game is open |
| Not in library | Removed from the library; the `.pkg` is still on the drive |
| Adding | Being added to the library |
| Installed on console | A normal installation of this game exists; PS4Mount leaves it alone |
| On another drive | The same game is also on another connected drive, which is the one used |

Buttons:

- **Remove from library**: removes the game from the home screen. The `.pkg` stays on the drive.
- **Add to library**: adds a removed game back.
- **Scan for games**: checks the drives now and shows how many games were found on each one.
- **Settings**: see below.
- **Log**: shows the PS4Mount log.
- **Stop**: stops PS4Mount. Its games cannot start until it is loaded again.

### Settings

![PS4Mount settings](docs/settings.png)

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Folders to search for pkgs | `/` | Folders, relative to each drive, where new `.pkg` files are picked up (one per line). `/` is the root. The `ps4` folder cannot be used: it holds the games already moved. |
| Add new games in groups | On | Adds many new games in groups instead of one after the other, which keeps the console stable when a drive has a lot of games. |
| Games per group | 5 | Size of each group (1 to 50). |
| Install add-ons (DLC) | On | Moves and installs add-on `.pkg` files. When off, add-ons are left where they are. |

Settings are saved in `/data/ps4mount/config.txt`.

The panel has no password. Anyone on your local network can open it.

### Removing games

Deleting a game from the PS5 (Options > Delete on the home screen, or Settings > Storage), or using
**Remove from library** in the panel, removes the game from the library and leaves the `.pkg` on the
drive. A removed game comes back
when you reconnect the drive or click **Add to library**.

To delete the game for good, delete its `/ps4/CUSAxxxxx` folder from the drive on a computer.

## Good to know

- Load PS4Mount soon after every boot. While it is not running, the console does not see the
  packages and may hide the games; they come back as soon as PS4Mount runs again.
- Do not unplug the drive while a game is running.
- **Two or more drives connected at the same time can make the whole console interface slow** (home
  screen, Control Center, game hubs), with or without PS4Mount: the system checks its storage devices
  more often with each extra drive or partition. A drive with extra partitions (for example a boot
  partition added by a multiboot tool) counts as several. If the interface gets slow, keep one drive
  connected, ideally with a single partition.
- For a game with an update, the library and the PS5's own "installed" notification show the version
  of the game pkg (for example 01.00). The game runs with the update; the web panel shows its version.
- Games already installed the normal way on the console are never touched, and their add-ons on the
  drive are not installed.
- Rest mode powers the drive off. The games stay in the library and work again after waking up.
- **Games with more than about 29 add-ons:** while a game runs, the console mounts each of its packages (the game,
  the update and every add-on) with two virtual devices: a PS4 package holds an outer filesystem with the
  real content as a second filesystem inside it. The console has 64 of these devices, so a running game
  can use at most about 30 packages: the game, its update and roughly 29 add-ons. A game with more
  add-ons (for example Civilization VII with 35) starts normally but only sees the first add-ons, in
  alphabetical order of their label. This is a console limit that applies to installed games too; it
  does not limit how many games you can have.
- If a game fails to start right after being added, start it again. The log (panel > **Log**) shows
  what happened.

## Reporting problems

If something does not work, open an issue at
[github.com/gasb07/ps4mount/issues](https://github.com/gasb07/ps4mount/issues) with:

1. **PS4Mount version**: shown at the top of the web panel and in the startup notification.
2. **PS5 firmware** and the **jailbreak / HEN** you use, with its version (for example etaHEN 2.x
   with kstuff).
3. **The game**: name and title ID (`CUSAxxxxx`), and whether it has an update (the version shown
   in the panel).
4. **What happened**: what you did, what you expected, and the exact message or error code shown on
   the console.
5. **The log**: open the web panel, click **Log** and copy the text, or download
   `/data/ps4mount/log.txt` over FTP. Include the part from the moment the problem happened.
6. **Your setup**: whether klogsrv is running, how the drive is formatted (exFAT) and other payloads
   you load at the same time.

Do not attach `.pkg` files or links to them.

## How it works

A PS4 PKG install on the PS5 is mostly a byte copy of the package to `/user/app/<TITLE_ID>/app.pkg`
plus some metadata. PS4Mount skips the copy:

1. It writes the files an install would leave on the console, generated from the package itself:
   `app.json`, `app.pbm`, `app.xml`, `patch.*`, the PlayGo records (`/user/playgo/...`,
   `/system_data/playgo/<TITLE_ID>/pfs.pbm`), the app metadata, and the fake license (`.rif`/`.idx`)
   decrypted from the package.
2. The game files go into an internal folder, `/system_data/ps4mount/app/<TITLE_ID>` (and
   `/system_data/ps4mount/patch/<TITLE_ID>` for an update), where `app.pkg` and `patch.pkg` are
   symbolic links to the packages on the drive. That folder is mounted over `/user/app/<TITLE_ID>`
   (and `/user/patch/<TITLE_ID>`) with `nullfs`. The drive itself is never mounted there.
3. It asks the system to register the title (`sceAppInstUtilAppInstallAll`), which adds it to the
   library and refreshes the home screen. PS4Mount never writes to the system databases itself.
4. A delete from the console can only remove the links, never the packages. While a delete screen
   is open (on the home screen or in Settings > Storage) PS4Mount also unmounts the game folders,
   so the system can remove `/user/app/<TITLE_ID>` without an error.

State and log are kept in `/data/ps4mount/`. The Media tab shortcut is `PMNT00001`
(`/user/app/PMNT00001`).

## Building

Requirements: the [PS5 Payload SDK](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/sdk) in `/opt/ps5-payload-sdk`
(or set `PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK`), `xxd` and bash.

```sh
./build.sh          # builds build/ps4mount.elf
```

Unit tests (crypto, the generated install files and the `param.sfo` parser) run on the computer, with
no console or SDK:

```sh
bash test/run.sh
```

GitHub Actions runs them before every build.

Optional tools:

```sh
python3 tools/make_icon.py                                 # redraws assets/icon0.png (needs Pillow)
python3 tools/gen_keys.py <LibOrbisPkg>/LibOrbisPkg/Util/Keys.cs   # regenerates src/keys.h
```

### Releases

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) builds every push and pull request with the PS5
Payload SDK release set in `SDK_VERSION`, and keeps `ps4mount.elf` as a build artifact.

To publish a release:

1. Set the new version in `src/main.c` (`#define VERSION "PS4Mount X.Y.Z"`) and commit it.
2. Tag the commit and push the tag:
   ```sh
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

The workflow checks that the tag matches `VERSION`, builds the payload and creates the GitHub
release with `ps4mount.elf` and its SHA-256 checksum attached.

| --- | --- |
| `src/main.c` | Daemon: drive scan, registration, mounts, klog events, panel actions |

| `src/build.c` | Generators for the install files (app/patch metadata, PlayGo records, license) |
| `src/db.c` | Library rows (`app.db`, `appinfo.db`) |
| `src/crypto.c` | SHA-256, AES-128-CBC, CRC32C, RSA-2048 |
| `src/logfile.c` | Keeps `log.txt` under 1 MB |
| `src/web.c`, `web/index.html` | Web panel |
| `test/` | Unit tests (`bash test/run.sh`) |
| `tools/pdb_*_template.bin` | PlayGo record layouts (no title data) |
